Regarding note 9:
* On Query 4, "order by retailerid, productid", the productid part was neccesary to match test.sh's output, but the handout only specifies order by retailerid, and not a required tiebreaker. Hence I made the assumption that whatever tibreaker condition was needed to match the output was fine, and decided on productid.
