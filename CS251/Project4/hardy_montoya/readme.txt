This marks my last late day.

Ferry covers most scenarios that are likely to be "real".

The sums both ran at appropiate increments of time for each test up to 10000, which I couldnt run remotely.  Even sshing into data, my laptop became slow (and for the most part had to be reset).

Cuckoo requires Coordinate.java, doesnt output correctly starting from a number I couldnt quite identify.

As usual, both algs4.jar and stdlib.jar are required.
